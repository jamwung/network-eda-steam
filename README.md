# Exploring the Steam Gaming Ecosystem using Network Analysis

![Steam](steam-image.jpeg)

Welcome to my Network Science project exploring Steam Store Games! This project was undertaken as part of my Network Science class at the Asian Institute of Management. In this project, I utilized network science techniques to analyze the relationships between developers, publishers, and game genres in the Steam gaming platform. For a comprehensive understanding of the project, please refer to the full blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@2010.jgwong/exploring-the-steam-gaming-ecosystem-using-network-analysis-9cedf4626b).

## Project Overview

This project focuses on three main aspects:

1. **Developer-Publisher Collaboration Network:** Investigating collaborations between game developers and publishers, uncovering influential players in the gaming industry, and identifying key game genres associated with these collaborations.

2. **Genre Interaction Network:** Exploring how different game genres are connected through shared developers and publishers, and identifying clusters of genres that tend to occur together.

3. **Bipartite Network of Games and Genres:** Constructing a network where games and genres are nodes, with edges representing the association between games and their genres. This allows us to understand the relationships between games independent of their genres.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Data:** The Steam Store Games dataset used for analysis is located in the `data` folder.

2. **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps are available in the `notebooks` folder.

3. **Figures:** Figures generated during the analysis are saved in the `figures` folder.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open the Jupyter notebooks to view the step-by-step analysis.

3. Feel free to experiment, modify, and extend the analysis for your own learning and insights.
